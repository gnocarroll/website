# website

This repository will contain the code for my personal website that I will eventually deploy at [georgeocarroll.com](https://georgeocarroll.com) (not deployed yet).

The backend will be a .NET Core Web API and the frontend will be Angular.

I plan on overengineering the website for education purposes.
